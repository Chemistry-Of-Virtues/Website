It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behavior or drug taking.Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean, in occupation and hobby, towards the arts, being, typically, creative and appreciative of the significance of intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self- actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences.Openness is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience.People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things.They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings.They are also more likely to hold unconventional beliefs.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.',

Conscientiousness is a tendency to display self-discipline, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is related to the way in which people control, regulate, and direct their impulses. High scores on conscientiousness indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. The average level of conscientiousness rises among young adults and then declines among older adults.',

        'positiveParagraph': 'Energetic, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking and domineering. Extroverted people may appear more dominant in social settings, as opposed to introverted people in this setting. Extraversion is characterized by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), surgency from external activity/situations, and energy creation from external means. The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full of energy. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion, with personality psychologist Eysenck suggesting that these traits are connected somehow to our central nervous system.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; instead they are more independent of their social world than extraverts. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Introverts need less stimulation than extraverts and more time alone. This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are reserved in social situations. Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion, with personality psychologist Eysenck suggesting that these traits are connected somehow to our central nervous system.',

It is also a measure of one\'s trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others.  Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy. The agreeableness trait reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others\' well-being, and are less likely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others\' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.',

        'positiveParagraph': 'High stability will generally manifest itself as a secure, confident, stable, calm personality.  However, it can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. They are less likely to allow the actions or words of others to affect them that lead to residual behavior from a wound that causes pain and trauma.  Individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to have worse psychological well being.  Individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low-scorers experience a lot of positive feelings.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Low stability, on the other hand, manifests as the reactive and excitable personality often found in dynamic individuals.  Someone with low stability can be perceived as sensitive, nervous, unstable and even insecure.  Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress, they also tend to be flippant in the way they express emotion.  They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high on neuroticism to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress. Lacking contentment in one\'s life achievements can correlate with high neuroticism scores and increase one\'s likelihood of falling into clinical depression.  Moreover, individuals high in neuroticism tend to experience more negative life events, but neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life experiences.',

    'Mind': {
        'category': 'Personality Aspects',
        'positive': 'Internal',
        'negative': 'External',
        'positiveParagraph': 'Internal focused individuals prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction. They tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation (e.g. sound, sight or smell) in general. They focus on things that are intangible and invisible.  INTERNAL FOCUSED people on the other hand, are more sensitive and need to escape the same stimuli in order to be more functional. They are intrinsic in finding themselves, which will generally exist solely within their individual mind.  Internal focused people are more centralized in their approach to find meaning in their own life and their own specific purposes.  INTERNAL FOCUSED people can quickly exhaust their mental energy reserves, and they will only tolerate such situations so long before they yearn for solitude and quiet.  To be internal in an external world tends to be a struggle for most because of the external stimuli.  Those who are INTERNAL FOCUSED are significantly more likely to report being sensitive to noise and bright colors, and they also strongly prefer a more simplistic lifestyle in their environment (especially if their Introversion is coupled with the INTELLECTUAL MORAL VIRTUE trait). Likewise, they do not seek or require much external stimulation.  Those individuals who are INTERNAL FOCUSED thrive on ideas and information that they can study and learn.  They may struggle to know who to share this information in a way for others to understand.  Communication with other people is more likely to be an in depth conversation and trying to avoid small talk, which to someone who is internal focused can be viewed as patronizing.   This concept also extends to things such as physical belongings and possessions, hobbies, and even how much time they spend with family and friends. Because the feelings and sensations that someone who is INTERNAL FOCUSED feels, one could even say that these individuals never actually feel as if they truly belong to this world. They may observe other people and events, but their mind remains directed both inwards and somewhere beyond always questioning, wondering and trying to make connections.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'External focused individuals prefer group activities and get energized by social interaction. They tend to be more enthusiastic and more easily excited than introverts. They focus on things that are tangible and visible.  People who are considered to be EXTERNAL FOCUSED in our model are not as sensitive to outer stimuli and need to seek them out in order to gain a kind of functional equilibrium and to perform well.  They are much more extrinsic in deriving their sense of self from exogenous factors.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, EXTERNAL FOCUSED people are more interested in engaging the environment – people and objects around them – and they need and thrive on others feedback as well. Their focus may be on obtaining things that they can see.  They are more energetic and willing to take the lead in many situations, especially social ones, and they enjoy pushing limits and challenging both themselves and those around them. People with EXTERNAL FOCUSED personality types are also more likely to feel that they can handle any challenges life throws their way. Obviously, whether that turns out to be true or not depends on many other circumstances, but generally speaking, EXTERNAL FOCUSED tends to be much more proactive in experiencing (and relying on) the external world around them.',

        'positiveParagraph': 'Individuals with the ACUTE (A) trait are deeply perceptive and can be extremely sensitive even to slight details or impressions. They are intelligent and quick to notice the simplest  details and understand them even without using words . Being perceptive and keen to their senses and feelings, they are incisive and astute to details that may not be said or even seen.  Individuals with the ACUTE trait prefer to rely on their penetrating and shrewd keenness of understanding, perception, or insight. They use their sensitivity to details or impressions they have to not only make decisions, but to explain the rationale behind their decisions. Someone who possesses the ACUTE personality trait may seem to make decisions that dismiss any logic or reason, however, because they trust their own intuition, they will stick with their decision without questioning why they feel a certain way.  ACUTE individuals talk about ideas and have no difficulties with allusions or reading between the lines.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Individuals are highly practical, pragmatic and down-to-earth. They tend to have strong habits and focus on what is happening or has already happened.  A person with the REASONING trait will form judgments through the process of logic and inference of fact to form conclusions and rational arguments.  Individuals with the REASONING trait focus on the actual world and things happening around them. They enjoy seeing, touching, feeling and experiencing.  They want facts to validate and substantiate the answers they are looking for.  Those who possess the REASONING trait will leave theories and things with "potential" to others. Any conclusion that is reached will be through induction, which will always provide the validity of their answers and/or decisions.  They want to stay logical in their approach, keeping their feet on the ground and mind out of the clouds, to focus on the present, instead of wondering why or when something might happen. Intuition, feelings, and even impressions will not be factored into their thought process or actions.  Consequently, people with this trait tend to be better at dealing with facts, tools and concrete objects as opposed to brainstorming about possibilities or future events, handling abstract theories, or exploring fantasy scenarios. REASONING types are also significantly better at focusing on just one thing at a time instead of bursting with energy and juggling multiple activities.  REASONING types focus on clarity, facts, logic, and practical matters.',

        'positiveParagraph': 'Individuals focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions. They tend to hide their feelings and see efficiency as more important than cooperation. It is the excellence of the mind.  People with INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE traits seek logic and rational arguments, relying on the thoughts of their mind rather than the thoughts of their heart.  They want to share their feelings and emotions in a logical way so as to be consistent in their approach.  A person who is more focused on INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE approach will tend to have a greater capacity to seek out knowledge and concrete understanding.  They do their best to safeguard their emotions, shielding them from the outside world and making sure that they are not clearly visible. “Whatever happens, you must always keep a cool head” – this is the motto of INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE types. However, this does not mean that these types are cold-hearted and incapable of offering MORAL VIRTUE. People with the INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE trait are often just as emotional as those with the MORAL VIRTUE trait – but they tend to suppress and override the MORAL VIRTUE with their rational logic approach.',
        'negativeParagraph': 'Individuals are sensitive and emotionally expressive. They are more empathic and less competitive than Thinking types, and focus on social harmony and cooperation. It is the excellence of character.  people with the MORAL VIRTUE trait follow their hearts and emotions and care little about hiding them. From their perspective, we should not be afraid to listen to our innermost feelings and share them with the world – these individuals tend to be compassionate, sensitive and highly emotional.  Someone with the MORAL VIRTUE trait will be more concerned with the principles of "right or wrong, good or bad" in human character.  They will be focused on the ethics behind someones behavior.  Because MORAL VIRTUE focuses more on the actions of a person, someone who has this trait will tend to look up to and surround themselves with others who hold or manifest high principles of proper conduct.  This may be subjective in their view, however, they see the actions of a person as a stronger indication of who that person truly is.    Those with the  MORAL VIRTUE trait would rather cooperate than compete, although it would be a big mistake to see them as naïve or easily swayed – quite the contrary, they are likely to fight tooth and nail for what they believe in. For many MORAL VIRTUE types, their principles and ideals are much more important than, say, professional success. Or, to put it another way, this is a different kind of logic, one rooted in assessments of the feelings of others – a decision that makes everyone happier is just as valid as a decision that gets the job done fastest.',

        'positiveParagraph': 'Decisive individuals are thorough and highly organized. They value clarity, predictability and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity.  People with the DECISIVE trait do not like to keep their options open – they would rather come up with five different contingency plans than just go ahead and deal with the challenges as they come. They are highly organized and prefer clarity and closure, always going with the plan rather than the flow. It is as if DECISIVE types always keep a mental checklist, and when something is crossed off that list, it is done and not open to reassessment. This goes as much for groceries (“What will that go with?”) as it does for life goals, like buying a house. Furthermore, DECISIVE individuals tend to have a very strong work ethic, putting their duties and responsibilities above everything else.  DECISIVE types tend to be much stricter when it comes to the letter of the law and order in their life. Individuals are thorough and highly organized.

        'negativeParagraph': 'Adaptive individuals are very good at improvising and spotting opportunities. They tend to be flexible, relaxed nonconformists who prefer keeping their options open.  They this does not mean that those who are ADAPTIVE are more prone to breaking or even bending laws, however, they are more apt to be flexible in their approach to the spirit of the law. ADAPTIVE individuals are much more flexible and relaxed when it comes to dealing with both expected and unexpected challenges. They can adjust to what is needed at any given time.  They are always scanning for opportunities and options, willing to jump at them at a moment’s notice. People with this trait are perfectly aware that life is full of possibilities, and they are reluctant to commit to something that might well prove to be an inferior option in the future. ADAPTIVE personality types are also likely to focus more on what makes them happy as opposed to what their parents, employers, or teachers expect – if a specific task is not that important or interesting, a ADAPTIVE individual will always be able to come up with something better to do. When all is said and done, ADAPTIVE types believe in novelty, in keeping an open mind, and in never-ending improvement.',
